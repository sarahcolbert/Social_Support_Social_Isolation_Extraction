# Using Natural Language Processing to Identify  Social Support and Social Isolation from Electronic Health Records of Psychiatric Patients: A Multi-Site Study

This repository maintains the code for identifying social support and social isolation with fine-grained categories (presence or absence of social network, emotional support, instrumental support, general and loneliness) using rule- and large language models (LLM)-based algorithms. 

## 1. For running rule-based algorithm
	python rule_based_classification.py

## 2. For running LLM 

### for fine-tunning the models
	python llm_fine_tune_all.py

### for testing the models
	python llm_sentence_classification_fine_tuned.py

We will update the GPU version of the LLM code soon.
